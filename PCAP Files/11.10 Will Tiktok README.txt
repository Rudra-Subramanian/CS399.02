6 experiments done over the course of about an hour and a half.
Each pcap file is around 10 minutes long. 
I took these steps (recording packets with tPacketCapture)

1. Restarted my phone, recording packets and leaving phone idle.
2. Installed Tiktok but didn't launch it. Recorded packets while idle.
3. Created an account on Tiktok, then closed the app. Recorded while idle.
4. Recorded packets while browsing Tiktok.
5. Restarted the phone, recorded packets while idle.
6. Uninstalled the app, restarted the phone, recorded packets while idle.
