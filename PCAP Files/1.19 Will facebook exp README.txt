6 experiments done over the course of about an hour and a half.
Each pcap file is around 10 minutes long. 
I took these steps (recording packets with tPacketCapture)

1. Restarted my phone, recording packets and leaving phone idle.
2. Installed Facebook but didn't launch it. Recorded packets while idle.
3. Logged into Facebook, then closed the app. Recorded while idle.
4. Recorded packets while browsing Facebook.
	("Feature for Facebook" installed during this time)
5. Restarted the phone, recorded packets while idle.
6. Uninstalled the app, restarted the phone, recorded packets while idle.
