This document will explain how to go about capturing packets from an iPhone
using the Wireshark software on macOS.


To start, you'll want to make sure your mac's software is as up-to-date as
possible so as to avoid any issues related to out-of-date software, since that
can be difficult to diagnose sometimes.

Once you've done that, you'll need to download the Wireshark software from their
official website. You should be able to find their 'Download' page on their
website at https://www.wireshark.org. (Make sure the download you select is
compatible with your computer's operating system.)

Once you've downloaded Wireshark, you'll need to go through the installation
process which your computer should guide you through once you click on the
download from the file's location in your computer.

In the meantime, grab your iPhone and a cord to connect it to your mac. Connect
your iPhone to your mac and open the finder. Once your devices are connected,
you should see your iPhone pop up in the left menu of your finder, at which
point you'll want to click on it. Once you've clicked on it and you see your
device's page open in the finder, you will see a bar with your iPhone's name and
a some other data information. Click that bar once and you should see your
iPhone's serial number and the UDID. Now, right-click the bar at the top of
the page and you should see an option that says "Copy UDID." Click that. Once
you've clicked it, open your terminal.

When you've gotten your terminal open, paste this command in your command line:
sudo installer -pkg /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Resources/Packages/MobileDeviceDevelopment.pkg -target /

If the command is successful, you should see something that says, "installer:
The upgrade was successful" or some variation of that. Once you see that, type
(without the quotes, substituting your UDID you copied): "rvictl -s <your UDID>"

Upon success, you should see something that says, "Starting device <your UDID>
[SUCCEEDED] with interface <interface name>"

At this point, go to Wireshark and find the interface name in the list of
connections on the homepage of the Wireshark app on your computer. Double-click
and you should see your packets being captured by the Wireshark software. :)


By defualt, Wireshark saves files in a PCAP format.
In order to get a .csv file for easier-analysis, Wireshark provides a tool to
do so under "Export Specified Packets".

Packets under protocol NaN, MDNS, ICMP, and NTP can be safely ignored for purposes of analysis.
